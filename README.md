## ⚙️ Working Process

This project uses MATLAB GUI to detect brain tumors from MRI images in a step-by-step visual manner. Here's how it works:

---

### 🖼️ 1. Load MRI Image
- Click on the **"Select Image"** button
- Choose a brain MRI image (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.)
- The image will be displayed in the first panel

---

### 🧹 2. Median Filtering
- Click **"Median Filtering"**
- Removes noise and smoothens the image using a 3x3 median filter
- Grayscale conversion is automatically handled

---

### ✂️ 3. Edge Detection
- Click **"Edge Detection"**
- Uses custom Sobel-based gradient operations (`Gx` and `Gy`) to highlight edges
- Shows outlines of structures within the brain

---

### 🧠 4. Tumor Detection
- Click **"Tumor Detection"**
- Steps involved:
  - Image is converted to binary using **adaptive thresholding**
  - Morphological operations (fill holes, open, close)
  - Skull region is removed by masking
  - Tumor region is extracted using:
    - **Area > 200 pixels**
    - **Solidity > 0.7**
  - Largest valid region is selected and its boundary is shown in **yellow**
- Displays **“Tumor Detected!”** or **“No Tumor Detected”** accordingly

### 💡 Key Techniques Used

| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `medfilt2` | Removes noise (Median Filter) |
| `imbinarize` | Adaptive image thresholding |
| `regionprops` | Extracts region area & solidity |
| `bwlabel` | Labels connected tumor regions |
| `bwboundaries` | Draws boundary of detected tumor |
